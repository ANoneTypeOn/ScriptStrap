## ReconStrap
Python script to make your routine recon tasks and scripts run automatically and give only important information

### Our goals
 - Make scripts written on different programming/scripting languages runnable from one main script
 - Make outputs of known utilities more compact and sanitized (when it's needed)
 - Make structure of project flexible and modifiable
 - Make automated saving to files with only important information

### How to use
``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Modifying
You can check "modules" folder in the project. This chapter will be extended later (maybe)
